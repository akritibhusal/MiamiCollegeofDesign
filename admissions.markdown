## APPLICATION CHECKLIST

{:#checklist}

The Application process for the Miami College of Design is intended to discern a beneficial and rewarding match between the candidates and the College’s unique learning environment. With this in mind, the application process consists of the following mandatory elements:

1. **Successful Completion of the [On-line Application](https://goo.gl/forms/xcFpQN1ky1KYMIQL2).** The On-line Application Form asks for your identifying information and your educational background. You will also submit your portfolio and an essay (See Items 5 and 6 below) through the On-line Application Form, so have all your material ready before you start to [fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kmcG6ybFMY9MQaWVICxuqNKc_Che-VgWtnmiESYnP-Q/edit). Students under 18 years of age must have the application signed by their parent(s) or legal guardian(s). If you are under 18 years of age, print out the Guardian Consent Form, have it signed by your guardian(s), and send it to the Office of Admissions.

2. **Transcript.** Applicants must provide official transcripts of all secondary academic work through the most recent grading period. High school counselors may submit transcripts through email or through regular mail to the Office of Admissions.

3. **English Language Competency.** Non-native speaking applicants must show proof of English Language competency. This includes a score of 60 on the TOEFL IBT or the IELTS (International English Language Testing System) exams, or documentation of ESL diploma program completion. Send proof of your test score to the Office of Admissions.

4. **Letters of Recommendation.** At least two letters are required and as many as four may be submitted. Recommendation letters should be written by teachers or professionals who have first-hand knowledge of your work and academic achievements and can comment on your potential as a Miami College of Design student. The letters of recommendation should be sent by the invited professionals directly to the Office of Admissions.

5. \*\* Portfolio.\*\* The portfolio must include at least five examples of your best recent work, either assigned projects or self-directed explorations. The work should reflect the full range of your ideas, interests, experience and abilities in design and engineering. Most often, the content of your portfolio goes beyond your classroom assignments and reveals the breadth and depth of your accomplishments. Ideally, you will have had a chance to develop your portfolio over time.

Work presented can be in any medium (including software, film, or video), in finished or sketch form. Your digital portfolio may include: code repositories, documents, pictures, videos, graphics, dioramas, notes, scribbles, multimedia presentations, blogs, spreadsheets, calculations, etc. Selected pages from a journal or sketchbook are recommended to demonstrate your research, thinking and investigation approach.

As a learning-centric design institution, we want to know about your learning and growth process, how you got from point A to point B. We are particularly interested in your self-reflections. What motivated you? What were your strategies when your designs didn’t work out as planned? What were you able to take away from a failed plan or prototype? Explanatory notes or documentation containing these reflections would be helpful to our appreciation of your work.

The Miami College of Design offers a series of workshops on how to develop your personal portfolio. We suggest you take advantage of this resource, come meet the team, and ask your questions. Sign up for one of these sessions [here](http://twitter.us13.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=22ea9a71440103660b3899d3f&id=d788a70a98).

Portfolios must be submitted electronically (through GitHub, Google Docs, DropBox, or some other file-sharing mechanism).

1. **Essay.** The essay is an opportunity for you to tell us about yourself, the things you do, and/or things that are important to you. Be creative. You can try storytelling, a shout out, a news article, a commentary, it’s up to you. We want to know you better, and we want to get a feel for your English-language writing skills. The essay should be no more than 1000 words.

2. **Application Fee.** An application fee of $25 will be charged to process your application. Send a cashier's check or money order to:

Integral Outsourcing Services LLC
