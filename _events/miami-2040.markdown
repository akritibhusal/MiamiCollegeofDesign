# ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGH DESIGN

MIAMI 2040 is an unprecedented opportunity for Miami’s youth to engage in solving the problems of the future city they will inhabit. Miami College of Design and high school students from South Florida will design solutions for the most daunting challenges for South Florida facing the next generation. At the end of a series of workshops, in which the students will have worked in teams with world-renowned industrial designers, their proposed solutions will be presented in June at DEEP SEE, a two-week public art installation on the shores of Miami Beach, adjacent to the US Conference of Mayors.

# MANAGING THE UNAVOIDABLE IN MIAMI

Beginning on 4 March, high-school students in South Florida will have an opportunity to do something tangible about climate change. Working with the design faculty of the Miami College of Design, workshop participants will engage in a six-week program to design both systemic and specific solutions for one of the first US regions projected to be partially underwater within the next several decades.

Every Saturday morning in March and the first half of April, students will gather in Wynwood to work with the faculty in hands-on sessions. Wednesday evenings, the faculty will hold office hours for fielding questions and providing additional mentoring.

At the 4 March workshop, students will work with a data scientist, applying models to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the private sector in order to define the conditions and specific risks that the City of Miami will face in 2040.

In subsequent workshops, the faculty of the Miami College of Design will apply the college’s philosophy of practical learning—learning-by-doing. Students will drive the conversation by identifying the problems they want to work on, self-selecting into design teams, which will be led through a process of discovery, framing, and prototyping, culminating in a design proposal.

The workshop series will cover the following topics:

* CLIMATE SCIENCE AND RISK
* INTRODUCTION TO THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGN PROCESS
* CONTEXTUALIZING DESIGN IDEAS WITH DATA SCIENCE
* IDEATION AND RAPID PROTOTYPING
* ENGAGEMENT WITH PRACTITIONERS
* TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY STUDIES
* DOCUMENTATION AND PRESENTATION OF DESIGNS TO CLIENTS
