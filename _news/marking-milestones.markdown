IAM Foundation president and vice chair of the Industrial Designers Society of America (IDSA) Florida Chapter, Franco Lodato is marking major milestones this month — the design school he’s co-launching has been given the green light by the Florida Department of Education to open next year. He’s also organizing a conference in November to promote industrial design during Miami Art Week.

Lodato has been the creative force behind the development the Motorola Razor, the Gillette 3, and Boeing Dreamliners, to name a few. He has been working in the field of industrial design and product development with the likes of Pininfarina and Herman Miller for 30 years – either through his studio “Bionics in Action”, as chief of product innovation for Skylabs, or most recently — as the the co-founder of Miami College of Design- Industrial Arts & Method (MCOD).

This month, Franco Lodato and engineer Walter Bender, former executive director of MIT Media Lab, announced that Miami College of Design- Industrial Arts & Method has received a license from the Florida Department of Education’s Commission for Independent Education and expects to open Fall 2017.

Miami College of Design then hopes to create an IDSA Student Chapter. MCID will support future leaders in design and innovation, as students interact with design principles in concert with the natural sciences, material sciences, computing, communications and structural engineering.

Lodato and Bender are also advocating innovation in industrial design education through the IAM Foundation, through a series of workshops, lectures, and the “Masters of Design” conference during the “Masters of Tomorrow” Summit in November.
“We’re gathering some of the world’s leading thinkers, creatives, technologists, entrepreneurs and artists to network, learn and get inspired to change the future”

Masters of Design will gather on November 30th from 9:00 am–6:00 pm at The Lab Miami / Miami Light Project 422 NW 26 Street. For a complete list of speakers or to learn more, visit: Masters of Tomorrow
