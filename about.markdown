## History
{:#history}

The Miami College of Design is the culmination of the dreams of two leaders in industrial design and design education, Franco Lodato and Walter Bender.

Franco Lodato is a renowned industrial designer for Motorola, Herman Miller, Ferrari-Maserati, Pininfarina and other global enterprises. He is also the founder and principal of iBionics and chief product Innovation of Skylabs.

Walter Bender is a founding member and former Executive Director of the MIT Media Lab, co-founder of One Laptop per Child, and founder of Sugar Labs, an organization that provides educational software to children around the world.

Lodato and Bender as collaborators at MIT in the 1990s observed that design and technology were closely integrated in the development of new products. Consequently, the ability to deliver interdisciplinary education has become more essential than ever before.

Lodato and Bender realized they could create an innovative college where students could interact with design principles and also with the natural sciences, material sciences, computing, communications, and structural engineering.

This innovative education concept got the attention of Antonio Malavé. Mr. Malavé is a serial entrepreneur in the Miami area where he focuses on real estate project development. He is an expert in organizational and operational management and therefore assumed the role of Chief Operating Officer and part owner. He is responsible for daily operations, resource management, and strategic planning.

## Vision and Purpose
{:#vision}

In today's competitive landscape, where high-technology businesses are becoming the common paradigm, innovation is crucial. To nurture talent, we must create learning environments in which there is creative tension between a shared vision (stability) and open-ended risk taking (instability). From these environments, top students will emerge who can innovate from chaos.

These students will generate long-term value through the development of distinctive products; they will be instrumental in the creation of the next generation of strategic businesses as they contribute with disruptive, breakthrough innovation leadership.
