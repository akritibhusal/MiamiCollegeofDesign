Courses are taken sequentially by level. Each semester credit hour is a unit consisting of a minimum of fifteen hours of instruction appropriate to the level of credential sought, during a semester, plus a reasonable period of time outside of instruction which is required for preparation for learning experiences, such as preparation for instruction, study of course material, or completion of educational projects.

The course numbers are based on course codes established by the school and do not relate to state common-course numbering systems. The course numbers were created by using the first few letters of the name of the program and then three numbers to indicate level or sequence. Courses numbered in the 100s and 200s are designed for students enrolled in both the associates and bachelors programs. Course numbers in the 300s and 400s are designed for students enrolled in the bachelors program. For example, ID-101 is an introductory level Industrial Design class intended for Year-1 students. ID-204 is a more advanced course in Industrial Design intended for Year-2 students. Similarly, MATH indicates courses in mathematics; COMP indicates courses in computer science; SOCSCI indicates courses in the social sciences; NATSCI indicates courses in the natural sciences; HUM indicates courses in the humanities; EPS indicates courses in business and entrepreneurship; and SM indicates academic seminars.

Students are provided with a course syllabus at the start of each course. It contains the following: 

* Method of evaluation
* Course requirements
* Value towards final grade

#### ID-199 Design Internship 1, 6 credit hours lab

This course provides an introduction to internships. Students are placed in internships according to their interests and through consultation with the Design Faculty. During the internship students engage in a shadowing process. The student shadows one or more designated employees at the industrial design company. The experience is customer design and is guided and supported by faculty and industrial mentors. Evaluation is based on weekly reports by the student and midterm and final reports by the mentor. Upon completion of this course, students will have an understanding of the role and responsibility of an intern and an understanding of the design work flow in an industrial work setting. (Prerequisite: ID-150)

#### ID-202 Special Projects in Wearables, 3 credit hours theory, 3 credit hours lab

This course provides a studio and lab environment for students to engage in a design project in wearable systems. Project teams will explore new concepts of wearable computing. Upon completion of this course, students will have an understanding of the constraints and demands that must be accounted for in order to design wearable solutions to problems in health and well-being, recreation, personal security, and social networking. (F. Ladato) (Prerequisite: ID-150)

#### ID-204 Special Projects in Education Technology, 3 credit hours theory, 3 credit hours lab

This course provides a studio and lab environment for students to engage in a design project in education technology. Project teams will explore new concepts of technology's role in learning. Upon completion of this course, students will have an understanding of the constraints and demands that must be accounted for in order to design devices and interventions that will satisfy the globally growing demand for education. (W. Bender) (Prerequisite: ID-150)

#### ID-250 Design Studio 2, 6 credit hours lab

This course provides instruction in industrial design and project development with an emphasis on social, cultural, or civic programs. The course builds on foundational design skills with more complex constraints and contexts. Upon completion of this course, students will be able to integrate aspects of design theory, design technology, and computation into the design process. (Design Faculty) (Prerequisite: ID-150)

#### ID-299 Design Internship 2, 6 credit hours lab

This course provides an internship experience. Students are assigned a selected work site according to their major interests. There is an on-site supervisor as well as student mentors who together with the student establish competency goals to be completed during the internship experience. Several evaluations will be conducted to ensure students meet internship objectives. Upon the completion of the internship, students will be experienced in the practical application of knowledge and skills they have learned in the didactic and supervised studio settings of instruction. (Design Faculty) (Prerequisite: ID-199)

#### ID-302 Advanced Projects in Wearables, 3 credit hours theory, 3 credit hours lab

This course provides an advanced studio and lab environment for students to engage in a design project in wearable systems. Project teams will explore new concepts of wearable computing in which they build upon the skills and tools that the students have already acquired. Upon completion of this course, students will have demonstrated a high methodical competence and a mastery of the design and engineering skills necessary to innovate in the wearable-computing field. (F. Lodato) (Prerequisite: any ID-200-level course)

#### ID-304 Advanced Projects in Education Technology, 3 credit hours theory, 3 credit hours lab

This course provides an advanced studio and lab environment for students to engage in a design project in education technology. Project teams will explore new concepts in which they build upon the skills and tools that the students have already acquired. Upon completion of this course, students will have demonstrated a high methodical competence and a mastery of the design and engineering skills necessary to innovate in the educational-technology field.
