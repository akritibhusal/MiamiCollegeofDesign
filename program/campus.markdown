## About the Campus
{:#about-campus}

Miami College of Design is located in the Historic Art District of Wynwood just a few blocks from the famous Wynwood Walls. The campus is located in a three-story 20,000 square foot stand-alone building with a student lounge, library area, and open classrooms. The building was renovated in mid-2016 using innovative design and space concepts.

## Labs, classrooms, and other space
{:#spaces}

Classroom, office and lab space are located on the first, second, and third floors of the building. Each is structured as “open floors” with industry-specific machine shops located in open self-contained areas. Tables, chairs, and dividers are all movable so that lab and classroom space can be created as needed and as required by the demands of the courses being taught. There are five (5) closed offices, and one 15x35 space for Executive offices. One area is designated for computers. A 15x12 space is designed for servers. There are three 12x12 faculty offices, an open student lounge, where the library and library computer workstations are located, and a 30x12 meeting/conference room. Restrooms are located on all floors. The roof holds solar panels and wind turbines. Part of the roof is enclosed to create a closed area where there are eating, recreation, and meeting rooms.
