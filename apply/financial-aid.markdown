## Industrial Arts & Method Scholars Program
{:#scholar}

Miami College of Design seeks to attract the most talented students both in and out of the State of Florida. The goal is to train talented individuals who will become innovators in their communities. Our focus is to deeply involve the local and greater industrial design communities to gain their support in the education of students who can one day make a difference to these organizations.

Our approach to student tuition assistance is to involve industry partners by establishing the Industrial Arts & Method Scholars Program. The program details include:

* Applicants must go through a rigorous admissions process showing that they have creativity, an innovative spirit, design talent and initiative, a teamwork mindset, and the goal to complete their studies within the time allotted;
* Accepted applicants will be named Industrial Arts & Method Scholars. Scholars will, wherever possible, be paired with an industry donor who has agreed to sponsor the Scholars Program;
* Scholars will, wherever possible, be assigned to a Sponsor work site for project and classroom work and internships;

To the extent that funds are available, tuition awards will be granted to each qualified student who is accepted into the Scholars Program. These are students who meet both the admission and the Scholars requirements). The awards program, known as Industrial Arts & Method Scholars Program, is an example of the innovative approach to post-secondary education tuition assistance developed by Miami College of Design. Up to 90% of tuition for qualified students will be paid through the scholars program. Students may qualify annually for scholarships while enrolled in either the Associate's or Bachelor’s degree programs.

There are 50 Industrial Arts & Method Scholarships available for 2017. Students who are awarded scholarships will be responsible for 10% of tuition. Example: If a student enrolls in 18 credit hours in a semester, the total tuition for that semester is US $18,360. The scholarship recipient will be responsible for US $1,836 of that total. Students who are not awarded scholarships will be responsible for 100% of tuition as described in the Tuition Section above. 

All students are responsible for the remaining portion of tuition, the one-time application fee of US $150, and learning materials, equipment, and supplies, which have an average cost of US $75 per course.

#### The Scholars Program Application Process

All applicants to the College and currently enrolled students in good standing are eligible to apply for the Scholars Program on an annual basis. New students will be considered for the program based upon their application for admission to the College as described in the Admissions Procedures and Requirements section of the Catalog. Currently enrolled students applying to the Scholars program must include examples of work from previous semesters. Continuing students may invite people to write letters of recommendation from College faculty and their mentors from industry.

Continuing students will be informed of their scholarship status three months prior to the Fall Semester.
