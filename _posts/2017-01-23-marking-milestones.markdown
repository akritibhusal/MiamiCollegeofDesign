Lodato has been the creative force behind the development the Motorola Razor, the Gillette 3, and Boeing Dreamliners, to name a few. He has been working in the field of industrial design and product development with the likes of Pininfarina and Herman Miller for 30 years – either through his studio “Bionics in Action”, as chief of product innovation for Skylabs, or most recently — as the the co-founder of Miami College of Design- Industrial Arts & Method (MCOD).

This month, Franco Lodato and engineer Walter Bender, former executive director of MIT Media Lab, announced that Miami College of Design - Industrial Arts & Method has received a license from the Florida Department of Education’s Commission for Independent Education and expects to open Fall 2017.

Miami College of Design then hopes to create an IDSA Student Chapter. MCID will support future leaders in design and innovation, as students interact with design principles in concert with the natural sciences, material sciences, computing, communications and structural engineering.

Lodato and Bender are also advocating innovation in industrial design education through the IAM Foundation, through a series of workshops, lectures, and the “Masters of Design” conference during the “Masters of Tomorrow” Summit in November.
